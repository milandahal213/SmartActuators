# Set up
- Update your SPIKE Prime to latest SPIKE3 firmware version.
- Start a new python project on the app.
- Copy and paste the code from the link above.
- Save it to your favorite slot (I like to put it on 0 for consistency)

# How to use it:
- Run the code from the slot.
- The sensors go to the ports on the left A C E. you can choose one, two or three sensors on ports of your choice.
- Motors go to the ports on the right (B, D,F). Again, you can choose as many motors as you want.
- The lines will show which sensor will control which motor(s).
  - If you have equal number of sensors and motors â€“ the sensor on the left will control motor on the right on the same line.
  - If you have one sensor and multiple motors, that one sensor will control all motors.
  - If you have extra motor or sensor , it will be ignored.
  - It is hot swap, so you can plug in and plug our sensors and motors till you find a configuration of your liking.

- Press right button to set the configuration. You may need to hold it for half a second. There will be a beep
- If you have more than one sensor motor pairs you will need to train for each configuration. More on that below.

# Training:
- Move the motor to the position of your choice, set the sensor to your preference and hold it. Now press left button to store the data.
- Move the motor to a different position, set the sensor to whatever position you want, and press left button to take another data. (Classic smart motor training system)
- Repeat step b for as many data points as you like.
- Press right button to indicate you are done storing data.
- Depending on if you have single sensor, you will either directly enter the run mode or you will train for another sensor motor pair. Once done training for next pair , press right button to indicate you are done.
- After you have trained all sensor motor pairs the motors will immediately start responding to the sensors.
