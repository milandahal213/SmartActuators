# Set up
- Go to https://spike.legoeducation.com
- Connect your SPIKE Prime and update to the latest SPIKE3 firmware version.
- Start a new Python project on the app.
- Copy and paste the contents of the sm.py file onto the project
- Save it to your favorite slot (I like to put it on 0 for consistency)

# How to use it:
- Run the code from the slot.
- The sensors go to the ports on the left A C E. You can choose one, two, or three sensors on ports of your choice.
- Motors go to the ports on the right (B, D, F). Again, you can choose as many motors as you want.
- The lines will show which sensor will control which motor(s).
  - If you have an equal number of sensors and motors â€“ the sensor on the left will control the motor on the right on the same line.
  - One sensor will control all motors if you have one sensor and multiple motors.
  - It will be ignored if you have an extra motor or sensor.
  - It is a hot swap, so you can plug in and plug our sensors and motors till you find a configuration of your liking.

- Press the right button to set the configuration. You may need to hold it for half a second. There will be a beep
- You must train for each configuration if you have more than one sensor motor pair. 

# Training:
- Move the motor to the position of your choice, set the sensor to your preference, and hold it. Now press the left button to store the data.
- Move the motor to a different position, set the sensor to whatever position you want, and press the left button to take more data. (Classic Smart Motor training system)
- Repeat step b for as many data points as you like.
- Press the right button to indicate you are done storing data.
- Depending on whether you have a single sensor, you will either directly enter the run mode or train for another sensor motor pair. Once done training for the next pair, press the right button to indicate you are done.
- After you have trained all sensor motor pairs, the motors will immediately start responding to the sensors.
