This repository has all the code related to SmartActuators. 
It is not currently on its final form. The code may not work on your system as it is constantly changed. Please exercise caution!

# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to bring all the SmartActuators, including SmartMotors, SmartSpeakers, SmartLight, codes together for different prototypes. 
We have tested the SmartActuators with different processors and they all require coding in different ways. And the framework from one prototype to the next is different. So there are different versions of the code. This repo will make it easier to access codes for each prototype as we keep testing the best hardware setup.
